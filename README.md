# PC Gamepass Save File Converter
Games available through PC Game Pass or purchased via the Xbox app keep their save files in an arbitrary file structure. This means if you purchase a game on another storefront moving your save files to or from the Xbox version is extremely difficult. This software aims to make that process easy.

Finds games by listing any Microsoft Store package with a wgs folder (believed to stand for "Windows Game Save"). This means some non-game applications may be shown

There is an extremely small (as of now at least) game library that contains the locations of non-Xbox save files. Some other game storefronts/save systems support multiple profiles, if this is the case with your game profiles will be shown by the file name identifying them. If your game is not found in this library you will be prompted to select the location manually when a package is selected.

It is strongly recommended you back up both save file folders before using this application.

Garen Thomas created a YouTube video going over the process for Forza Horizon 5 (although he also covers some pitfalls that have hopefully been fixed since he created it):
